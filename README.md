# Wobblecode-Editor
An (attempted) Wobbledogs code editor for creating or editing dog codes.

Made with the help of an extensive number of people stemming (mostly) from the Wobbledogs Discord, this project aims to make a lightweight app for Wobbledog code editing. Building off the winding and unwinding code of Player_1234 and with extensive notation from eLe, we've managed the framework of a dog code reader (from raw code to binary, with separation of GENE_PROP_00, GENE_PROP_01, GENE_DOM_REC, and the extras like personality, age, etc.) The hope is, with edits to dogcode_schema, one can flexibly update for added information in newer dog code versions, while also providing human-readable tagging for ease of filtering/implementation into a GUI. 
Unfortunately, I have no background in Python nor GUI coding, and I'm not a terribly... dedicated programmer. I hope to put this out such that others can robustly update the code for new versions, come up with a GUI, or just rip it entirely and run off with it. Please feel free to reach out to me on Discord (Tora#4562) if you have any questions!
